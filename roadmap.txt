1. Scope - a place where they all live (variables and functions)
    - global scope
    - function scope
    - no block scope
    - last declaration wins (no methods overrides)
2. Hoisting in scope
    - hoisiting of function assignments
3. Closure - ability to access scope variables when function is invoked outside of its scope
4. Objects
    - object literals
    - accessing object properties
    - constructor functions
5. This - created for scope, binded on call time
6. Prototypes
    - inheritance
